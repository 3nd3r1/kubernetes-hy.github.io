This course is an introductory course to Kubernetes with K3s and GKE. In this course, you will develop software with a microservice architecture that utilizes Kubernetes to serve software that scales and deploys automatically. And learn how to manage it all.

**This course can not be completed with the faculty computers.** Attendees need to provide their own computers
with admin / superuser priviledges.

Course details and starting instructions can be found in [part 0](/part-0).

Registration is only required for ECTS credits. The certificate does not require registration or separate sign up. For ECTS credits (Finnish / Open University students) the registration is after you've completed part 2 and there will be a link at the end of the part.

You should also read the [courses.helsinki.fi page](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt21027en/135660523). This page also includes information about target group, enrolment instructions, recommended reading and most importantly **deadlines**.
