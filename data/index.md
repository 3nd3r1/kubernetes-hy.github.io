This course is an introductory course to Kubernetes with K3s and GKE. In this course, you will develop software with a microservice architecture that utilizes Kubernetes to serve software that scales and deploys automatically. And learn how to manage it all.

**This course can not be completed with the faculty computers.** Attendees need to provide their own computers
with admin / superuser privileges.

Course details and starting instructions can be found in [part 0](/part-0).

Registration is only required for ECTS credits. The certificate does not require registration or separate sign up. For ECTS credits (Finnish / Open University students) the registration is after you've completed part 2 and there will be a link at the end of the part.

You should also read the [studies.helsinki.fi page](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cur/otm-0bd9249b-cd12-46eb-b095-a471cc0cd5e9). This page also includes information about target group, enrolment instructions, recommended reading and most importantly **deadlines**.

This course may be challenging as it expects that you

- are familiar with containers (probably from <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/aytkt21025en">DevOps with Docker</a>).
- are able to independently develop web software (probably from <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt21009">Full Stack Web Development</a>).
- have knowledge of SQL databases (probably from <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt10004">Introduction to Databases</a>).
- know basics of networking (probably from <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt200041">Introduction to Data Communication</a>).

The fall 2021 iteration of the course is open for a shorter time period and includes deadlines for each week. Here is a timetable:

| Part   | Opens | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Part 1 | 4.11  | 18.11    |
| Part 2 | 11.11 | 25.11    |
| Part 3 | 18.11 | 2.12     |
| Part 4 | 25.11 | 9.12     |
| Part 5 | 2.12  | 16.12    |

Even though we are locking away parts of the course on https://devopswithkubernetes.com, the material is still available on the github page https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/kubernetes-hy.github.io/tree/master/data. However, you won't be able to submit anything early or late!

  <p>
    Our values Users first, Best ideas win, In it together and Go bold guide our work. Our impact by the numbers is impressive and describes the level of the challenges we get to solve. Apps developed by Unity creators are downloaded 3 billion times per month, we have creators in 190+ countries and 50% of games are powered by Unity.
