In this part, we learned about k8s, k3s, and k3d. We learned about resources that are used in Kubernetes to run any software as well as resources to manage storage for some use cases, for example, caching and sharing data between Pods.

By now we know what the following are and how to use them:
 - Pods
 - Deployments
 - Services
 - Ingress
 - Volume

With them, we're ready to deploy simple software to a Kubernetes cluster. In the next part we'll learn more about management as well as a number of cases where the tools we have acquired so far are not enough.
